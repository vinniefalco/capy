## Section: Buffers

### Part I: Philosophy and Design

1. **Platform-Agnostic I/O Algorithms**
   - Generic `read()`, `write()`, stream algorithms work with any conforming type
   - No dependency on platform I/O (IOCP, io_uring, epoll, kqueue)
   - Algorithms implemented against concepts, not concrete types
   - Same code works with real sockets, SSL streams, mock objects, or custom implementations
   - Enables testing without actual network I/O

2. **Why Buffers?**
   - I/O operations work with contiguous memory regions
   - The fundamental unit: `(pointer, size)` pair
   - OS reads/writes bytes from/to linear addresses

3. **Scatter/Gather I/O**
   - Motivation: avoid copying when data isn't contiguous
   - Real-world examples:
     - HTTP message: headers + body written together
     - WebSocket frame: frame header + payload
   - `readv()`/`writev()` system calls (vectored I/O)
   - Efficiency: fewer syscalls, zero-copy message assembly

### Part II: Buffer Types

4. **const_buffer and mutable_buffer**
   - `const_buffer`: read-only view of contiguous bytes
   - `mutable_buffer`: writable view of contiguous bytes
   - Construction, accessors, prefix removal
   - Reference: `<boost/capy/buffers.hpp>`

5. **Creating Buffers with make_buffer**
   - From pointer + size
   - From C arrays, std::array, std::vector
   - From std::string, std::string_view
   - Reference: `<boost/capy/buffers/make_buffer.hpp>`

### Part III: Buffer Sequences

6. **What is a Buffer Sequence?**
   - Bidirectional range with buffer-convertible value type
   - Single buffers are degenerate sequences
   - Reference: `ConstBufferSequence`, `MutableBufferSequence` concepts

7. **Iterating Buffer Sequences**
   - `begin()` and `end()` for uniform access
   - `consuming_buffers` for incremental consumption
   - Real I/O loop patterns from `read()` and `write()`
   - Reference: `<boost/capy/buffers/consuming_buffers.hpp>`

### Part IV: Buffer Algorithms

8. **Measuring Buffers**
   - `buffer_size`: total bytes across all buffers
   - `buffer_empty`: check if total size is zero
   - `buffer_length`: number of buffers (not bytes)

9. **Copying Buffers**
   - `buffer_copy`: copy between buffer sequences
   - Optional `at_most` parameter
   - Reference: `<boost/capy/buffers/buffer_copy.hpp>`

### Part V: Dynamic Buffers

10. **The Producer/Consumer Model**
    - Dynamic buffers as intermediate storage between producer and consumer
    - Producer: network I/O writes data into the buffer
    - Consumer: application reads and processes the data
    - Synchronization through prepare/commit/consume prevents overflow/underflow

11. **The DynamicBuffer Concept**
    - Producer side: `prepare(n)` -> write data -> `commit(n)`
    - Consumer side: `data()` -> read data -> `consume(n)`
    - Capacity management: `size()`, `max_size()`, `capacity()`
    - Reference: `<boost/capy/concept/dynamic_buffer.hpp>`

12. **DynamicBufferParam for Coroutines**
    - Safe parameter passing rules
    - Lvalue vs rvalue constraints
    - The `is_dynamic_buffer_adapter` tag

13. **Provided Implementations**
    - `flat_dynamic_buffer`: linear, single-buffer sequences
    - `circular_dynamic_buffer`: ring buffer (classic producer/consumer)
    - `vector_dynamic_buffer`: growable, backed by std::vector
    - `string_dynamic_buffer`: backed by std::string

## Section: I/O Streams

I/O streams enable data to flow through different parts of a program, represented as buffer sequences. Six concepts define how data is produced and consumed: streams handle partial transfers, sources and sinks handle complete transfers with EOF signaling, and buffer sources/sinks use the callee-owns-buffers pattern for zero-copy efficiency. Type-erasing wrappers let you express APIs independent of the underlying transport.

### Part I: Stream Concepts (Partial I/O)

The stream concepts are intentionally modeled after the Boost.Asio concepts _AsyncReadStream_ and _AsyncWriteStream_.

1. **ReadStream**
   - Provides `read_some(buffers)` for partial read operations
   - Returns `(error_code, size_t)` - may transfer less than requested
   - Caller owns the buffers; stream fills as much as available
   - On success: at least 1 byte read; on EOF: `ec == cond::eof`, `n == 0`
   - Reference: `<boost/capy/concept/read_stream.hpp>`

2. **WriteStream**
   - Provides `write_some(buffers)` for partial write operations
   - Returns `(error_code, size_t)` - may transfer less than requested
   - Caller owns the buffers
   - Reference: `<boost/capy/concept/write_stream.hpp>`

### Part II: Source/Sink Concepts (Complete I/O with EOF)

Sources and sinks build on streams.

3. **ReadSource**
   - Provides `read(buffers)` for complete read operations
   - Fills entire buffer or returns EOF/error with partial count
   - Caller owns the buffers
   - Reference: `<boost/capy/concept/read_source.hpp>`

4. **WriteSink**
   - Provides `write(buffers)`, `write(buffers, eof)`, `write_eof()`
   - Complete write with explicit EOF signaling
   - Caller owns the buffers
   - After successful `write_eof()` or `write(buffers, true)`, no further writes permitted
   - Reference: `<boost/capy/concept/write_sink.hpp>`

### Part III: Buffer Concepts (Callee-Owns-Buffers)

5. **BufferSource**
   - Provides `pull(arr, max_count)` - fills array with `const_buffer` descriptors
   - Returns `(error_code, count)` where `count == 0` means source exhausted
   - Source owns the buffers; caller must consume all before next `pull()`
   - Enables zero-copy: source provides pointers to its internal storage
   - Reference: `<boost/capy/concept/buffer_source.hpp>`

6. **BufferSink**
   - Provides `prepare(arr, max_count)` - synchronous, returns writable buffer count
   - Provides `commit(n)`, `commit(n, eof)`, `commit_eof()` - async finalization
   - Sink owns the buffers; caller writes directly into sink's internal storage
   - Enables zero-copy: no intermediate buffer needed
   - Reference: `<boost/capy/concept/buffer_sink.hpp>`

### Part IV: Transfer Algorithms

7. **Composed Read/Write**
   - `read(stream, buffers)` - loops `read_some` until buffer full or error
   - `read(source, dynamic_buffer)` - loops until EOF into growable buffer
   - `write(stream, buffers)` - loops `write_some` until all written
   - Reference: `<boost/capy/read.hpp>`, `<boost/capy/write.hpp>`

8. **push_to (Caller Owns Buffers)**
   - Source provides buffers via `pull()`, data is pushed to destination
   - `push_to(BufferSource, WriteSink)` - complete transfer with EOF signaling
   - `push_to(BufferSource, WriteStream)` - streaming with partial writes
   - Reference: `<boost/capy/io/push_to.hpp>`

9. **pull_from (Callee Owns Buffers)**
   - Sink provides buffers via `prepare()`, data is pulled from source
   - `pull_from(ReadSource, BufferSink)` - complete reads into sink's buffers
   - `pull_from(ReadStream, BufferSink)` - streaming with partial reads
   - Naming reflects buffer ownership; no buffer-to-buffer variant (would require redundant copying)
   - Reference: `<boost/capy/io/pull_from.hpp>`

### Part V: Type-Erasing Wrappers

Each concept has a corresponding type-erasing wrapper in `<boost/capy/io/>`:

10. **Stream Wrappers**
    - `any_read_stream` - wraps any `ReadStream`
    - `any_write_stream` - wraps any `WriteStream`
    - `any_stream` - wraps bidirectional (both `ReadStream` and `WriteStream`)

11. **Source/Sink Wrappers**
    - `any_read_source` - wraps any `ReadSource`
    - `any_write_sink` - wraps any `WriteSink`
    - `any_buffer_source` - wraps any `BufferSource`
    - `any_buffer_sink` - wraps any `BufferSink`

12. **Wrapper Characteristics**
    - Reference semantics: wrap existing objects without ownership
    - Preallocate coroutine frame at construction for zero steady-state allocation
    - Move-only (non-copyable); cached frame reused across operations
    - Constructor takes reference to concrete type; wrapped object must outlive wrapper

### Part VI: Processing Chains

13. **Composing Transformations**
    - Data flows: Source -> Transform -> Transform -> Sink
    - Each component satisfies a concept (e.g., `BufferSource`, `WriteSink`)
    - Chain compression, decompression, encryption, framing, chunked encoding
    - Intermediate transforms implement both source and sink concepts

### Part VII: Transport-Independent APIs

14. **The Key Value Proposition**
    - Type-erasing wrappers allow APIs independent of underlying transport
    - Same code works with corosio sockets, Boost.Asio adaptors, TLS streams, mock streams
    - Echo server example:
      ```cpp
      task<> handle_connection(any_stream& stream) {
          char buf[1024];
          for(;;) {
              auto [ec, n] = co_await stream.read_some(mutable_buffer(buf));
              if(ec == cond::eof) break;
              if(ec.failed()) co_return;
              auto [wec, wn] = co_await write(stream, const_buffer(buf, n));
              if(wec.failed()) co_return;
          }
      }
      ```
    - HTTP body example:
      ```cpp
      task<> send_body(any_write_sink& body, std::string_view data) {
          auto [ec, n] = co_await body.write(make_buffer(data), true);
      }
      ```
    - The concrete transport is hidden; library code works with any conforming implementation
