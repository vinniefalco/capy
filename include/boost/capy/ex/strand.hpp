/** Provides serialized coroutine execution for any executor type.

    A strand wraps an inner executor and ensures that coroutines
    dispatched through it never run concurrently. At most one
    coroutine executes at a time within a strand, even when the
    underlying executor runs on multiple threads.

    Strands are lightweight handles that can be copied freely.
    Copies share the same internal serialization state, so
    coroutines dispatched through any copy are serialized with
    respect to all other copies.

    @par Invariant
    Coroutines resumed through a strand shall not run concurrently.

    @par Implementation
    The strand uses a service-based architecture with a fixed pool
    of 211 implementation objects. New strands hash to select an
    impl from the pool. Strands that hash to the same index share
    serialization, which is harmless (just extra serialization)
    and rare with 211 buckets.

    @par Executor Concept
    This class satisfies the `Executor` concept, providing:
    - `context()` - Returns the underlying execution context
    - `on_work_started()` / `on_work_finished()` - Work tracking
    - `dispatch(h)` - May run immediately if strand is idle
    - `post(h)` - Always queues for later execution

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.
    Shared objects: Safe.

    @par Example
    @code
    thread_pool pool(4);
    auto strand = make_strand(pool.get_executor());

    // These coroutines will never run concurrently
    strand.post(coro1);
    strand.post(coro2);
    strand.post(coro3);
    @endcode

    @tparam E The type of the underlying executor. Must
        satisfy the `Executor` concept.
