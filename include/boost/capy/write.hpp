/** Asynchronously write the entire buffer sequence.

    Writes data to the stream by calling `write_some` repeatedly
    until the entire buffer sequence is written or an error occurs.

    @li The operation completes when:
    @li The entire buffer sequence has been written
    @li An error occurs
    @li The operation is cancelled

    @par Cancellation
    Supports cancellation via `stop_token` propagated through the
    IoAwaitable protocol. When cancelled, returns with `cond::canceled`.

    @param stream The stream to write to. The caller retains ownership.
    @param buffers The buffer sequence to write. The caller retains
        ownership and must ensure validity until the operation completes.

    @return An awaitable yielding `(error_code, std::size_t)`.
        On success, `n` equals `buffer_size(buffers)`. On error,
        `n` is the number of bytes written before the error. Compare
        error codes to conditions:
        @li `cond::canceled` - Operation was cancelled
        @li `std::errc::broken_pipe` - Peer closed connection

    @par Example

    @code
    task<> send_response( WriteStream auto& stream, std::string_view body )
    {
        auto [ec, n] = co_await write( stream, make_buffer( body ) );
        if( ec.failed() )
            detail::throw_system_error( ec );
        // All bytes written successfully
    }
    @endcode
