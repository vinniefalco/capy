/** An asynchronous event for coroutines.

    This event provides a way to notify multiple coroutines that some
    condition has occurred. When a coroutine awaits an unset event, it
    suspends and is added to an intrusive wait queue. When the event is
    set, all waiting coroutines are resumed.

    @par Zero Allocation

    The wait queue node is embedded in the wait_awaiter, which lives on
    the coroutine frame during suspension. No heap allocation occurs.

    @par Thread Safety

    This event is NOT thread-safe. It is designed for single-threaded
    use where multiple coroutines may wait for a condition.

    @par Example
    @code
    async_event event;

    task<> waiter() {
        co_await event.wait();
        // ... event was set ...
    }

    task<> notifier() {
        // ... do some work ...
        event.set();  // Wake all waiters
    }
    @endcode
