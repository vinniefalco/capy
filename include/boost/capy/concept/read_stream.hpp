/** Concept for types providing awaitable read operations.

    A type satisfies `ReadStream` if it provides a `read_some`
    member function template that accepts any @ref MutableBufferSequence
    and is an @ref IoAwaitable yielding `(error_code,std::size_t)`.

    @par Syntactic Requirements
    @li `T` must provide a `read_some` member function template
        accepting any @ref MutableBufferSequence
    @li The return type of `read_some` must satisfy @ref IoAwaitable
    @li The awaitable's result must decompose to
        `(error_code,std::size_t)` via structured bindings

    @par Semantic Requirements
    If `buffer_size( buffers ) > 0`, the operation reads one or more
    bytes from the stream into the buffer sequence:

    @li On success: `!ec`, and `n` is the number of bytes
        read (at least 1).
    @li On error: `ec`, and `n` is 0.
    @li On end-of-file: `ec == cond::eof`, and `n` is 0.

    If `buffer_empty( buffers )` is `true`, the operation completes
    immediately. `!ec`, and `n` is 0.

    Buffers in the sequence are filled completely before proceeding
    to the next buffer.

    @par Buffer Lifetime
    The caller must ensure that the memory referenced by `buffers`
    remains valid until the `co_await` expression returns.

    @par Conforming Signatures
    @code
    // Templated for any MutableBufferSequence
    template< MutableBufferSequence MB >
    IoAwaitable auto read_some( MB const& buffers );

    template< MutableBufferSequence MB >
    IoAwaitable auto read_some( MB buffers );  // by-value also permitted
    @endcode

    @warning **Coroutine Buffer Lifetime**: When implementing coroutine
    member functions, prefer accepting buffer sequences **by value**
    rather than by reference. Buffer sequences passed by reference may
    become dangling if the caller's stack frame is destroyed before the
    coroutine completes. Passing by value ensures the buffer sequence
    is copied into the coroutine frame and remains valid across
    suspension points.

    @par Example
    @code
    template< ReadStream Stream >
    task<> read_all( Stream& s, char* buf, std::size_t size )
    {
        std::size_t total = 0;
        while( total < size )
        {
            auto [ec, n] = co_await s.read_some(
                mutable_buffer( buf + total, size - total ) );
            if( ec )
                co_return;
            total += n;
        }
    }
    @endcode
