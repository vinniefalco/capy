/** Transfer data from a BufferSource to a WriteSink.

    This function pulls data from the source and writes it to the
    sink until the source is exhausted or an error occurs. When
    the source signals completion, `write_eof()` is called on the
    sink to finalize the transfer.

    @tparam Src The source type, must satisfy @ref BufferSource.
    @tparam Sink The sink type, must satisfy @ref WriteSink.

    @param source The source to pull data from.
    @param sink The sink to write data to.

    @return A task that yields `(std::error_code, std::size_t)`.
        On success, `ec` is default-constructed (no error) and `n` is
        the total number of bytes transferred. On error, `ec` contains
        the error code and `n` is the total number of bytes transferred
        before the error.

    @par Example
    @code
    task<void> transfer_body(BufferSource auto& source, WriteSink auto& sink)
    {
        auto [ec, n] = co_await push_to(source, sink);
        if (ec)
        {
            // Handle error
        }
        // n bytes were transferred
    }

/** Transfer data from a BufferSource to a WriteStream.

    This function pulls data from the source and writes it to the
    stream until the source is exhausted or an error occurs. The
    stream uses `write_some()` which may perform partial writes,
    so this function loops until all pulled data is consumed.

    Unlike the WriteSink overload, this function does not signal
    EOF explicitly since WriteStream does not provide a write_eof
    method. The transfer completes when the source is exhausted.

    @tparam Src The source type, must satisfy @ref BufferSource.
    @tparam Stream The stream type, must satisfy @ref WriteStream.

    @param source The source to pull data from.
    @param stream The stream to write data to.

    @return A task that yields `(std::error_code, std::size_t)`.
        On success, `ec` is default-constructed (no error) and `n` is
        the total number of bytes transferred. On error, `ec` contains
        the error code and `n` is the total number of bytes transferred
        before the error.

    @code

        auto [ec, n] = co_await push_to(source, stream);
