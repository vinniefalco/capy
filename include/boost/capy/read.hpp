/** Asynchronously read until the buffer sequence is full.

    Reads data from the stream by calling `read_some` repeatedly
    until the entire buffer sequence is filled or an error occurs.

    @li The operation completes when:
    @li The buffer sequence is completely filled
    @li An error occurs (including `cond::eof`)
    @li The operation is cancelled

    @par Cancellation
    Supports cancellation via `stop_token` propagated through the
    IoAwaitable protocol. When cancelled, returns with `cond::canceled`.

    @param stream The stream to read from. The caller retains ownership.
    @param buffers The buffer sequence to fill. The caller retains
        ownership and must ensure validity until the operation completes.

    @return An awaitable yielding `(error_code, std::size_t)`.
        On success, `n` equals `buffer_size(buffers)`. On error,
        `n` is the number of bytes read before the error. Compare
        error codes to conditions:
        @li `cond::eof` - Stream reached end before buffer was filled
        @li `cond::canceled` - Operation was cancelled

    @par Example

    @code
    task<> read_message( ReadStream auto& stream )
    {
        char header[16];
        auto [ec, n] = co_await read( stream, mutable_buffer( header ) );
        if( ec == cond::eof )
            co_return;  // Connection closed
        if( ec.failed() )
            detail::throw_system_error( ec );
        // header contains exactly 16 bytes
    }
    @endcode
