/** Concept for types that provide awaitable write operations.

    A type satisfies `WriteStream` if it provides a `write_some`
    member function template that accepts any @ref ConstBufferSequence
    and is an @ref IoAwaitable whose return value decomposes to
    `(error_code,std::size_t)`.

    @tparam T The stream type.

    @par Syntactic Requirements

    @li `T` must provide a `write_some` member function template
        accepting any @ref ConstBufferSequence
    @li The return type of `write_some` must satisfy @ref IoAwaitable
    @li The awaitable's result must decompose to
        `(error_code,std::size_t)` via structured bindings

    @par Semantic Requirements

    If `buffer_size( buffers ) > 0`, the operation writes one or more
    bytes of data to the stream from the buffer sequence:

    @li On success: `!ec`, and `n` is the number of bytes
        written.
    @li On error: `ec`, and `n` is 0.

    If `buffer_empty( buffers )` is `true`, the operation completes
    immediately. `!ec`, and `n` is 0.

    Buffers in the sequence are written completely before proceeding
    to the next buffer.

    @par Buffer Lifetime

    The caller must ensure that the memory referenced by `buffers`
    remains valid until the `co_await` expression returns.

    @par Conforming Signatures

    @code
    template< ConstBufferSequence Buffers >
    IoAwaitable auto write_some( Buffers buffers );
    @endcode

    @warning **Coroutine Buffer Lifetime**: When implementing coroutine
    member functions, prefer accepting buffer sequences **by value**
    rather than by reference. Buffer sequences passed by reference may
    become dangling if the caller's stack frame is destroyed before the
    coroutine completes. Passing by value ensures the buffer sequence
    is copied into the coroutine frame and remains valid across
    suspension points.

    @par Example

    @code
    template< WriteStream Stream >
    task<> write_all( Stream& s, char const* buf, std::size_t size )
    {
        std::size_t total = 0;
        while( total < size )
        {
            auto [ec, n] = co_await s.write_some(
                const_buffer( buf + total, size - total ) );
            if( ec )
                co_return;
            total += n;
        }
    }
    @endcode

    @see IoAwaitable, ConstBufferSequence, awaitable_decomposes_to
